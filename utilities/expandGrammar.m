function [gExp, vecExp] = expandGrammar(grammar, compVec)

% EXPANDEDGRAMMAR expands the nested structure of a grammar based on the
% rules it encodes.  Also creates a matrix that contains the progressively
% uncompressed versions of the compressed vector compVec.
%
% Input
%   grammar  - a number of rules by 2 cell array. The first column has the
%              left hand side of each replacement rule while the second
%              column has the right hand side (so the first column lists
%              all non-terminals in the grammar).
%   compVec  - a vector that has been compressed using grammar.
%
% Output
%   gExp     - a number of rules by 1 cell array.  It is the expanded
%              version of the input grammar obtained by applying the rules
%              encoded in the grammar.  It contains the progressively
%              expanded version of each of the rules in the grammar.  For
%              any given entry gExp{ii}{end} contains only terminal
%              symbols.

% !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
% this funciton uses strrep on a vector of doubles, which works but would
% normally issue a warning saying it doesn't work...  It's called many
% times, so turn off warning
