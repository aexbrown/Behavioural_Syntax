function [angleArray, meanAngles] = angle(x, y)

%given a series of x and y coordinates over time, calculates the angle
%between each vector making up the skeleton and the x-axis.  The mean angle
%is subtracted from each frame so that the average orientation is always
%the same in the output angleArray.
