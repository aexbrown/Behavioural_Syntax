    compressiveNFast(dataVec, nMax)

% COMPRESSIVEN Finds the sequence in dataVec that results in the largest
% compression when it is replaced by a new rule, but only searches n-grams
% up to nMax to save time.  See the following paper for more details on the
% non-approximate version:
% Nevill-Manning and Witten (2000) On-Line and Off-Line
% Heuristics for Inferring Hierarchies of Repetitions in Sequences.
% Proceedings of the IEEE 88:1745.
%
% !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
% N.B. In the case of ties, where two subsequences would give equal
% compression, Nevill-Manning takes the one that occurs first in the
% sequence, whereas here we take the one that occurs first in the sorted
% unique n-grams.  This can change the grammar that is produced by
% compressSequenceNFast and the total compression achieved.
%
% There may also be similar differences between using compressiveN and
% compressiveNFast because of the way unique() sorts strings vs. numerical
% values.

% Input
%   dataVec     - a row vector of numbers to be compressed
%   nMax        - the maximum length n-gram to check for compression
%
% Output
%   sequence    - the sequence in dataVec that results in the best
%                 compression when replaced with a new rule (best
%                 compression balances a high frequency against a long
%                 sequence)
%   locations   - the locations where sequence occurs
%   bestSavings - the compression achieved by making the replacements (this
%                 takes into account the size of the rule that is created)
